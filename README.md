Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to set up a simple WordPress site based on the twentyfifteen theme with a few new functionalities described below.

## Instructions

- Use the twentyfifteen theme and add a custom post type called Event.
- Each event should have a name, description, date of event, location of event, type (Concert, Play, Conference, Festival,...) and different characteristics of which it can have more than 1 (Free parking, e-ticket, lunch included, early bird,...). You can get creative with the types and characteristics. 
- Create a page that shows a list of events with 5 events per page and a pager at the bottom. 
- Create a simple filter / sort above the list
- You can click on an event to get to an event specific page which shows the details of the event

## Bonus points:
- When entering event data in Wordpress if you choose the type Conference or festival show a second date field that allows you to enter a 'To' date. This date should also show up in the list and the event details page.
- Adding any animations or your own improvements on the base task
- Package the whole functionality as a wordpress plugin. You can use the [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](http://wppb.io/) (generator: [http://wppb.me/](http://wppb.me/))
